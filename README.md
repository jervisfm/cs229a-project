A project to build a machine learning model that can recognize handwritten letters.


# Project Setup
We use Conda for package / dependency management.  You can get a copy of conda for your platform here: https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

One can then create a suitable environment as follows:

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

You can then activate the environment with:

```

```

To pull in any updated dependencies, one can execute
```
$ conda env update
```
